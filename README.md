# CNN-dog-breed

In this project, I define a CNN to classify different dog breeds from the dataset. However, to define step by step a complex model often presents a lower performance level than a pre-trained model. 

Consequently, I also (i) add explainability in the defined CNN, and (ii) load a pre-trained model to classific the dog breeds.

I attach the Jupyter notebook (``CNN_dogs.ipynb``) and also the environment info (.yml file).
